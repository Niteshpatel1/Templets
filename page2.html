            <p>
                Café, small eating and drinking establishment, historically a coffeehouse, usually featuring a limited
                menu; originally these establishments served only coffee. The English term café, borrowed from the
                French, derives ultimately from the Turkish kahve, meaning coffee.

                Café Coffee Day, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India’s favourite hangout for coffee and
                conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our
                coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad
                to be a part of their lives.
